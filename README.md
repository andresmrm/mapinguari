# The Fearsome Mapinguari

In this game you are the fearsome Mapinguari and must scare some villans out of the forest.

[Play!](http://andresmrm.gitlab.io/mapinguari/)

## How to run the code?

### 1. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/

### 2. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser


### 3. Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
